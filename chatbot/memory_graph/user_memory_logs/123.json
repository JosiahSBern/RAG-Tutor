Key points: uses '&' in function parameter (e.g., `int &num`), passes a direct link/alias to the original variable's memory, allows the function to directly modify the original variable, and is useful for modifying original data or for efficiency with large objects (avoiding copies). Analogy used: drawing directly on a shared whiteboard."}
